## NVIDIA: How to Get Started With Large Language Models on NVIDIA RTX PCs — **Upgraded**
Many users want to run large language models (LLMs) locally for more privacy and control, but until recently, this meant a trade-off in output quality. Newly released open-weight models, like OpenAI’s gpt-oss and Alibaba’s Qwen 3, can run directly on PCs, delivering useful high-quality outputs, especially for local agentic AI. This opens up new opportunities Read Article

## AWS: Modernize fraud prevention — **Upgraded**
In this post, we demonstrate how to implement real-time fraud prevention using GraphStorm v0.5's new capabilities for deploying graph neural network (GNN) models through Amazon SageMaker. We show how to transition from model training to production-ready inference endpoints with minimal operational overhead, enabling sub-second fraud detection on transaction graphs with billions of nodes and edges.
