## AWS: Introducing structured output for Custom Model Import in Amazon Bedrock — **Announced**
Today, we are excited to announce the addition of structured output to Custom Model Import. Structured output constrains a model's generation process in real time so that every token it produces conforms to a schema you define. Rather than relying on prompt-engineering tricks or brittle post-processing scripts, you can now generate structured outputs directly at inference time.
