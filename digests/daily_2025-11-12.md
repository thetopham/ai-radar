## AWS: Introducing agent — **Announced**
In this post, we demonstrate how you can use the A2A protocol for AI agents built with different frameworks to collaborate seamlessly. You'll learn how to deploy A2A servers on AgentCore Runtime, configure agent discovery and authentication, and build a real-world multi-agent system for incident response. We'll cover the complete A2A request lifecycle, from agent card discovery to task delegation, showing how standardized protocols eliminate the complexity of multi-agent coordination.

## AWS: A guide to building AI agents in GxP environments — **Upgraded**
The regulatory landscape for GxP compliance is evolving to address the unique characteristics of AI. Traditional Computer System Validation (CSV) approaches, often with uniform validation strategies, are being supplemented by Computer Software Assurance (CSA) frameworks that emphasize flexible risk-based validation methods tailored to each system's actual impact and complexity (FDA latest guidance).
