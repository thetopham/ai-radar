## AWS: Practical implementation considerations to close the AI value gap — **Upgraded**
The AWS Customer Success Center of Excellence (CS COE) helps customers get tangible value from their AWS investments. We've seen a pattern: customers who build AI strategies that address people, process, and technology together succeed more often. In this post, we share practical considerations that can help close the AI value gap.

## AWS: Introducing bidirectional streaming for real — **Announced**
We're introducing bidirectional streaming for Amazon SageMaker AI Inference, which transforms inference from a transactional exchange into a continuous conversation. This post shows you how to build and deploy a container with bidirectional streaming capability to a SageMaker AI endpoint. We also demonstrate how you can bring your own container or use our partner Deepgram's pre-built models and containers on SageMaker AI to enable bi-directional streaming feature for real-time inference.
