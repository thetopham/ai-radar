## NVIDIA: Marine Biological Laboratory Explores Human Memory With AI and Virtual Reality — **Upgraded**
The works of Plato state that when humans have an experience, some level of change occurs in their brain, which is powered by memory — specifically long-term memory. This change is what Andre Fenton, professor of neural science at New York University, and Abhishek Kumar, assistant professor of cell and regenerative biology at the University Read Article

## AWS: Move Beyond Chain — **Upgraded**
This post explores Chain-of-Draft (CoD), an innovative prompting technique introduced in a Zoom AI Research paper Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less, that revolutionizes how models approach reasoning tasks. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been the go-to method for enhancing model reasoning, CoD offers a more efficient alternative that mirrors human problem-solving patterns—using concise, high-signal thinking steps rather than verbose explanations.
