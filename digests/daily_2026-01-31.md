## AWS: Evaluating generative AI models with Amazon Nova LLM — **Upgraded**
Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) goes beyond statistical metrics like perplexity or bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores. For most real-world generative AI scenarios, it’s crucial to understand whether a model is producing better outputs than a baseline or an earlier iteration. This is especially important for applications such as summarization, content generation, […]

## AWS: Scale AI in South Africa using Amazon Bedrock global cross — **Upgraded**
In this post, we walk through how global cross-Region inference routes requests and where your data resides, then show you how to configure the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions and invoke Claude 4.5 models using the global inference profile Amazon Resource Name (ARN). We also cover how to request quota increases for your workload. By the end, you'll have a working implementation of global cross-Region inference in af-south-1.
