## AWS: Structured outputs on Amazon Bedrock — **Upgraded**
Today, we're announcing structured outputs on Amazon Bedrock—a capability that fundamentally transforms how you can obtain validated JSON responses from foundation models through constrained decoding for schema compliance. In this post, we explore the challenges of traditional JSON generation and how structured outputs solves them. We cover the two core mechanisms—JSON Schema output format and strict tool use—along with implementation details, best practices, and practical code examples.

## AWS: Manage Amazon SageMaker HyperPod clusters using the HyperPod CLI and SDK — **Upgraded**
In this post, we demonstrate how to use the CLI and the SDK to create and manage SageMaker HyperPod clusters in your AWS account. We walk through a practical example and dive deeper into the user workflow and parameter choices.

## AWS: Evaluate generative AI models with an Amazon Nova rubric — **Upgraded**
In this post, we explore the Amazon Nova rubric-based judge feature: what a rubric-based judge is, how the judge is trained, what metrics to consider, and how to calibrate the judge. We chare notebook code of the Amazon Nova rubric-based LLM-as-a-judge methodology to evaluate and compare the outputs of two different LLMs using SageMaker training jobs.
